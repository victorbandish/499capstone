Introduction
•	Hello, my name is Victor, and this is my Milestone One code review for CS 499
•	I am reviewing a C++ course management application developed in a data structures course
•	I will explain existing functionality, analyze the code using the CS 499 Code Review Checklist, and discuss planned enhancements
•	The enhancements will demonstrate growth in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases
Artifact Overview / Existing Functionality
•	The application supports academic course planning
•	It reads course data from a CSV file
•	Stores course number, title, and prerequisites
•	Uses a menu-driven interface
•	Allows users to:
o	Load course data
o	Print a sorted list of courses
o	Search for a specific course
•	At a high level, the program reads structured data, stores it in memory, and supports basic queries
Code Review – Structure
•	Code correctly implements core functionality
•	Opens and parses a CSV file
•	Creates course objects and stores them in a container
•	Provides menu options for printing and searching
•	Original design goal was to use a binary search tree
•	Current implementation uses a vector
•	Sorting is done each time courses are printed
•	Searching is done with a linear scan
•	Code works, but does not fully meet the intended data structure design
•	This is a major planned enhancement
Structure – Modularity and Efficiency
•	Code style and formatting are consistent
•	Functions are separated into logical tasks
•	Too much control flow lives in main
•	Planned refactor into:
o	File parsing component
o	Data storage component
o	User interface controller
•	No unreachable code or leftover stubs
•	Repeated patterns in printing and error handling
•	Storage use is inefficient due to repeated vector copying and sorting
•	Default filename is a magic string and should become a named constant
Documentation
•	Code is heavily commented
•	Many comments restate what the code is doing
•	Planned shift to higher-quality comments
•	Focus on explaining intent and design decisions
•	Add function-level documentation:
o	Purpose
o	Inputs
o	Outputs
o	Error behavior
•	Ensure comments remain consistent during refactoring
Variables
•	Variable names are clear and meaningful
•	Types are used consistently
•	Course fields stored as strings
•	Prerequisites stored as a vector of strings
•	CSV parsing does not trim whitespace
•	Extra spaces could break searching
•	Planned improvements:
o	Trim whitespace
o	Normalize course number casing
•	No obvious unused variables, but will re-evaluate after refactoring
Arithmetic Operations
•	Program does not perform floating-point arithmetic
•	No division or numerical edge cases
•	Most arithmetic checklist items are not applicable
•	Focus remains on data parsing and retrieval
Loops and Branches
•	File parsing loop is clear and correctly terminated
•	CSV parsing loop reads remaining comma-separated values
•	Search loop exits as soon as a match is found
•	Menu uses a switch statement with a default case
•	User input is not validated
•	Non-numeric input could break the program
•	Planned improvement:
o	Validate and sanitize all user input
o	Recover gracefully from invalid input
Defensive Programming
•	openFile exits immediately if the file is missing
•	This prevents graceful recovery
•	Planned change:
o	Return an error status or throw and handle exceptions
•	Input data is assumed to be complete
•	No validation for malformed CSV lines
•	Planned additions:
o	Validate required fields
o	Handle empty or malformed records safely
•	Ensure program behaves correctly if actions are taken before data is loaded
•	Ensure files are always handled and closed predictably
Planned Enhancements – Software Design and Engineering
•	Refactor into a cleaner architecture
•	Separate concerns:
o	File parsing
o	Data storage
o	User interaction
•	Improve error handling and input validation
•	Reduce repetitive code
•	Improve documentation quality and consistency
Planned Enhancements – Algorithms and Data Structures
•	Replace vector-based storage with a binary search tree
•	Improve search efficiency
•	Eliminate repeated sorting
•	Use in-order traversal for sorted output
•	Document time-complexity improvements and trade-offs
Planned Enhancements – Databases
•	Application already uses structured persistent data via CSV
•	Planned improvements:
o	Validate records on input
o	Normalize stored data
o	Enforce consistent formatting
o	Possibly export cleaned data
•	Focus on:
o	Data persistence
o	Reliable retrieval
o	Data integrity
•	These align with core database concepts
Conclusion
•	Application provides a solid functional foundation
•	Checklist review identified improvement areas in:
o	Structure
o	Efficiency
o	Defensive programming
•	Planned enhancements will:
o	Improve modularity and professionalism
o	Strengthen algorithmic efficiency
o	Improve structured data handling
•	Enhancements demonstrate growth across all three CS 499 categories
•	Thank you for reviewing my Milestone One submission
