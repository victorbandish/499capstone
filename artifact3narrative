The artifact selected for this enhancement is the course planning application originally developed in CS 300, Analysis and Design. The original version of this program was created earlier in the Computer Science program to read course data from a CSV file and manage it using in-memory data structures. The application allows users to load course information, display a sorted list of courses, and view individual course details along with their prerequisites. For Milestone Four, this artifact was enhanced to incorporate a database-backed design using SQLite, transforming it from a file-driven application into one that demonstrates persistent data storage and structured querying.
This artifact was selected for inclusion in my ePortfolio because it provided a natural opportunity to demonstrate database fundamentals within a familiar problem domain. The original program already relied on structured data, making it well-suited for migration to a relational database. By introducing SQLite, I was able to design database tables for courses and prerequisites, enforce relationships between those tables, and use SQL queries to retrieve and present data. Specific components that showcase my database skills include the creation of a relational schema, the use of primary and foreign keys to maintain data integrity, and the implementation of SQL queries with ordering and filtering. The enhancement improved the artifact by replacing temporary in-memory storage with persistent database storage, allowing the data to remain available across program executions and better reflecting real-world application design.
This enhancement met the course outcomes I originally planned to address in Module One, particularly the outcome focused on demonstrating the use of appropriate tools and techniques in computing practices for database development. The project also supports the outcome related to designing and evaluating computing solutions by requiring thoughtful decisions about schema design, data normalization, and query structure. No major updates to my outcome-coverage plan were necessary, as the database integration aligned closely with my original goals for this artifact.
Through the process of enhancing this application, I gained a deeper understanding of how database systems integrate with application-level code. Working with SQLite required me to think more carefully about how data is structured, stored, and retrieved, rather than relying solely on program memory. One challenge I encountered was configuring the development environment correctly so that the database library could be compiled and linked within a C++ project. Resolving this issue improved my understanding of how external libraries are incorporated into native applications. Overall, this enhancement strengthened my confidence in designing applications that use databases effectively and reinforced the importance of persistence, data integrity, and structured querying in professional software development.
