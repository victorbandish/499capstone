The artifact selected for this enhancement is the course planning application originally developed in CS 300, Analysis and Design. The original version of this program was created earlier in the Computer Science program to read course data from a CSV file and manage it using linear in-memory data structures. The application allows users to load course information, display a sorted list of courses, and view individual course details along with their prerequisites. For Milestone Three, this artifact was enhanced to incorporate a Binary Search Tree (BST), transforming it from a simple linear storage model into one that demonstrates deeper algorithmic reasoning and data structure implementation.
This artifact was selected for inclusion in my ePortfolio because it provided a strong opportunity to demonstrate my understanding of algorithms and data structures within a practical application. The original program relied on sequential storage and sorting mechanisms, which were functional but did not fully illustrate advanced computational design. By introducing a Binary Search Tree, I was able to implement recursive insertion, recursive search operations, and in-order traversal for sorted output. Specific components that showcase my algorithmic skills include the design of the BST node structure, the recursive insert and search methods, and the use of in-order traversal to produce sorted results without relying on additional sorting functions. The enhancement improved the artifact by increasing average-case search efficiency and demonstrating a more scalable approach to data organization.
This enhancement met the course outcomes I originally planned to address in Module One, particularly the outcome focused on designing and evaluating computing solutions using algorithmic principles and appropriate data structures. The project also supports the outcome related to applying well-founded computing techniques by requiring thoughtful decisions about time complexity, memory management, and structural design. The shift from linear storage to a tree-based model required careful evaluation of performance trade-offs, reinforcing the importance of selecting appropriate data structures based on problem requirements. No major changes to my outcome coverage plan were necessary, as implementing the BST directly aligned with my intended focus on algorithmic growth.
Through the process of enhancing this application, I developed a stronger understanding of recursion, pointer management, and tree traversal patterns. One challenge I encountered was ensuring that node insertion and search logic correctly maintained the ordering properties of the tree without introducing logical errors. Additionally, implementing proper memory cleanup through recursive destruction reinforced the importance of responsible resource management in C++. Overall, this enhancement strengthened my ability to think algorithmically, evaluate performance implications, and implement structured data solutions that reflect professional-level problem solving.
